Determining whether a book is scholarly involves looking at several clues. First, check the publisher - is it a University Press or a reputable publisher in the field?

Kingbot is not a research tool or a replacement for librarian and library staff expertise.

The service is based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method which allows the use of local data to provide the informational content and library website links in a chatbotâ€™s response. Local datasets for Kingbot include crawled library website pages, library website research guides, and frequently-asked-questions from previous instances of Kingbot.
